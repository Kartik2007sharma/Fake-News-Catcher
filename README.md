FAKE NEWS CATCHER

Tech stack- Python Machine Learning(Numpy, Pandas and Scikit-learn)

Purpose- Nowadays many fake news are circulating on the internet, whether it is on WhatsApp, Instagram, X(Twitter) or any other social media application. This results in the fake or wrong knowledge gaining of people around the globe. This project is made to find out whether a news article is fake or genuine with the help of sources from the internet and machine learning.

Procedure-
1. Gathered a diverse dataset consisting of both fake and legitimate news articles from various sources. Preprocessed the data by cleaning and formatting text,
removing noise, and extracting relevant features using Pandas and NumPy.
2. Trained the machine learning model support vector machines (SVM), using Scikit-learn to increase performance, precision and accuracy and deployed a feature to
also, find out whether a single news article is fake or not with up to 85-95% accuracy.
3. Utilized natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract numerical values from the text data. Employed techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse
Document Frequency), and word embeddings to represent the textual content in a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
4. Used some modules and algorithms like- Tfid Vectorizer and Linear SVC(Support Vector Machine ) on the Jupyter Notebook for the Machine Learning Algorithm to
understand the text articles.
